This is NOT A PRODUCTION GRADE APP!!!

For an example of a tested Python3 app please see https://github.com/backenddeveloper/ForSecond

This was put together in under 3 hours (to satisfy the requirements of the test brief).

General assumptions include:
- Money is quantized at the penny level
- The purpose of the application is to add items and values to an items table and total them
